// The second voice of the daily read: what specific accounts the user follows are saying
// on X — not a market-wide search. A cashtag search across all of X reads thousands of
// posts a day and burned through the account's balance in one run; nine authors read a
// few dozen posts a day between them, so the cost is small and predictable instead of
// tracking however loud the whole platform got that day.
//
// X closed every free door — guest tokens answer 403, nitter is gone, and the syndication
// endpoints rate-limit on the first request and cannot search at all. The official API wants
// $200 a month for ten thousand posts. So this reads through twitterapi.io, a pay-per-use
// reseller: $0.15 per thousand posts, no subscription.
//
// The key lives in .x-key beside the repo (or TWITTERAPI_KEY in the environment) and is never
// committed. Without it this module returns nothing and the daily read falls back to
// StockTwits alone — the site must never depend on a secret being present.
//
// One honest difference from StockTwits, and the page says so: StockTwits authors tag their
// own posts Bullish or Bearish, so we quote a label the person chose. On X there is no such
// tag, so the direction below is MEDUSA's reading of the words. To keep that reading from
// being a guess, a post is kept only when it is plainly one-sided; anything balanced or
// unreadable is dropped rather than labelled.
